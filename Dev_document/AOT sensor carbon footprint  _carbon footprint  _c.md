# AOT sensor carbon footprint

carbon footprint  
carbon footprint reduction

Based on your location in Thailand and recent interest in environmental sensors (PM2.5, CO2, combustion), your query likely refers to one of three distinct subjects.

The most probable "AOT" entity in your region is **Airports of Thailand**, but in a technical sensor context, "AOT" typically refers to **Aerosol Optical Thickness** or the **Array of Things** project.

### 1. Airports of Thailand (AOT) Initiatives

If you are asking about the carbon footprint strategy of **Airports of Thailand (AOT)**, they have launched a "Green Airport" initiative to achieve Net Zero emissions.

* **Reduction Strategy:** AOT aims to reduce carbon emissions by **50%** within 4 years and achieve Net Zero by 2032.[^1]
* **Key Technologies:**
    * **Solar Power:** Installing rooftop solar panels (aiming for 50% renewable energy usage within 4 years) to offset electricity emissions (Scope 2).[^1]
    * **Electric Vehicles (EVs):** Replacing 4,000+ taxis and 3,400 operational vehicles with EVs to lower combustion emissions.[^2][^1]
    * **Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF):** Encouraging airlines to use SAF, which significantly lowers the carbon footprint of flights (Scope 3).[^1]


### 2. Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) Sensors

In technical environmental monitoring (relevant to your interest in PM2.5 and dust sensors), **AOT** (often used interchangeably with AOD - Aerosol Optical Depth) is a critical metric.

* **What it measures:** AOT measures how much sunlight is prevented from reaching the ground by particles (aerosols) in the air. It is a direct proxy for **air quality** and **particulate matter (PM2.5)** concentration.[^3][^4]
* **Relation to Carbon Footprint:** AOT detects **Black Carbon** (soot) and organic carbon emitted from incomplete combustion (vehicles, industry, biomass burning). High AOT values often indicate inefficient combustion and high carbon emissions in a specific area.[^5][^6]
* **Sensor Types:**
    * **Sun Photometers:** Ground-based sensors (like those in the AERONET network) that look at the sun to measure AOT.[^7]
    * **Satellite Sensors:** Instruments like MODIS or OMI on satellites measure AOT globally to track pollution plumes.[^6]


### 3. Array of Things (AoT) Sensors

If you encountered the specific phrase "AoT sensor," it likely refers to the **Array of Things** project, an urban sensing network (originally from Chicago) designed to act as a "fitness tracker" for cities.

* **Capabilities:** These "AoT nodes" are modular sensor boxes that measure **Carbon Monoxide (CO)**, **Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂)**, Ozone, and PM2.5.[^8][^9]
* **Usage:** They provide hyper-local data on pollution sources, helping cities identify "hotspots" for carbon emissions and traffic congestion.[^10]


### Carbon Footprint Reduction Strategies (Sensor-Based)

To reduce carbon footprint using the sensor systems you are investigating (CO2, Power Meters, MQTT), the standard approach involves three steps:


| Step | Sensor Role | Action |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **1. Baseline** | **Power Meters / CO2 Sensors:** Continuous logging of energy usage and emissions to establish a "Business As Usual" baseline [^11]. | Identify peak usage times and inefficient equipment. |
| **2. Optimization** | **AOT / PM2.5 / Gas Sensors:** Detect abnormal combustion or high pollution levels in real-time. | Tune combustion engines or HVAC systems to run more efficiently, reducing fuel/energy waste. |
| **3. Verification** | **Reporting Dashboard:** Compare current sensor data against the baseline to verify reductions. | Generate reports for standards like ISO 14064 (Greenhouse Gas accounting) [^12]. |

> **Note:** If you specifically meant **AOTF** (Acousto-Optic Tunable Filter), this is a type of high-end optical component used in spectral sensors to precisely identify gases like CO2 and NO2 by their light signature.[^13][^14]
